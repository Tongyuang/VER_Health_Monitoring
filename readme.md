# VER Health Monitoring


## Introduction

This project aims at developing a real-time emotion monitoring system on edge devices to recognize the emotion by analyzing the speaker's voice intonation.
People often carry their mobile phones with them, so we can collect the voice from microphone and complete emotion monitoring without the user's deliberate cooperation.
